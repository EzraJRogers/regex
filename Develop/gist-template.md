# Comprehensive Guide to Regular Expressions (Regex)
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text processing. They allow you to define patterns that can match strings with precision, making them indispensable in tasks like data validation, parsing, and text manipulation.

## Summary
This tutorial aims to provide a thorough understanding of various components of regex and how they function within patterns.

# Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors specify positions in the text where the regex pattern should match. Examples include ^ for the start of a line and $ for the end of a line.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. Examples include *, +, ?, and {}.

### OR Operator
The OR operator (|) allows you to specify alternatives in the regex pattern, matching either one expression or another.

### Character Classes
Character classes allow you to match any one of a set of characters. They are denoted by square brackets ([]). For example, [a-zA-Z] matches any uppercase or lowercase letter.

### Flags
Flags modify how the regex engine interprets the pattern. Common flags include i for case-insensitive matching and g for global matching.

### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses () are used for grouping parts of a pattern together. They also capture the matched substring for later use.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions ([...]) match any one of the characters inside the brackets. They are useful for defining custom character classes.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Quantifiers in regex are greedy by default, meaning they match as much as possible. Adding ? after a quantifier makes it lazy, matching as little as possible.

### Boundaries
Boundaries (\b and \B) assert positions where certain conditions are met, such as word boundaries or non-word boundaries.

### Back-references
Back-references (\1, \2, etc.) allow you to match the same text that was matched by a capturing group earlier in the regex pattern.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead ((?=...)) and look-behind ((?<=...)) assertions allow you to assert whether a pattern is or isn't followed by another pattern, without including it in the match.
